CodeSplash Homepage replaces your Chrome new tab page with a clean, customizable homepage for your bookmarks.

Organize your most-visited sites into folder tabs and arrange them exactly how you want with drag-and-drop reordering. Upload your own icons for any bookmark, or let the extension fetch favicons automatically. Set a custom background image for the whole homepage or per individual folder.

Features:
- Folder tabs to group bookmarks by project, category, or however you like
- Drag and drop to reorder bookmarks, move them between folders, and rearrange folder tabs
- Custom icons — upload any image, or use automatic favicons
- Custom background images per folder
- Adjustable icon sizes, grid layout, title font size, and text color
- Right-click any page to quickly add it to your homepage
- Toolbar popup for adding the current page in one click
- Sort bookmarks alphabetically within any folder

All data is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. Nothing is sent to a server. No account required, no tracking, no data collection.

Lightweight and fast — the homepage loads instantly every time you open a new tab.
